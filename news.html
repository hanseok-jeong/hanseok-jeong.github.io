    <p class="news-desc">
      The lab held a one-night, two-day winter retreat at Vivaldi Park in Hongcheon, sharing New Year resolutions and plans for the coming year in a meaningful and refreshing atmosphere. It also marked a historic moment—the lab’s first “peaceful transfer of power,” from Kyungmin to Juseong. Our sincere appreciation goes to Kyungmin for her more than three years of devoted service, and our preemptive sympathy (and thanks) goes to Juseong, who now steps into the line of duty.

          Wuseong and Kyungmin departed for a two-week short-term training program at Purdue University. They planned to work as short-term interns in Professor David Yu’s research group and to participate in an online seminar with Professor Rabin Bhattarai at UIUC. After the training, they also scheduled about two weeks of personal travel across the United States. We hope they would learn and experience as much as possible during this meaningful stay.
