    <div class="news-title">Feb 1, 2024 — Winter Lab Retreat</div>
    <p class="news-desc">
      The lab held a one-night, two-day winter retreat at Vivaldi Park in Hongcheon, sharing New Year resolutions and plans for the coming year in a meaningful and refreshing atmosphere. It also marked a historic moment—the lab’s first “peaceful transfer of power,” from Kyungmin to Juseong. Our sincere appreciation goes to Kyungmin for her more than three years of devoted service, and our preemptive sympathy (and thanks) goes to Juseong, who now steps into the line of duty.
