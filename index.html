      <!-- Lab Vision -->
      <p class="lead">
        Our vision is <em>Environmental Intelligence for Informed Decisions.</em> Toward this vision, we pursue Truth-Telling through Unfolding the Possibility Spaces and Understanding the Complexity, grounded in three core pillars: Complexity Science, Physically-Based Models, and Exponential Technologies. Complexity science is for better comprehension of human–nature interactions, physically-based models for better representations of environmental processes, and exponential technologies for better interpretations of environmental big data.
      </p>

      <!-- Lab Targets -->
      <p class="lead">
        Albert Einstein once remarked, “Environment is everything.” Our three pillars are not confined to the natural environment alone but also include us—human beings—recognizing that humans and nature are inseparable in addressing today’s global challenges confronting our communities.

  <h1 style="font-family:'Consolas','Courier New',monospace; color:#243b53;">
    Environmental Intelligence
  </h1>
  <p>
    Our concept of Environmental Intelligence refers to an integrative intelligent system that supports informed decisions toward a world where humans and nature are harmonized. 
    It originates from the recognition of environmental systems as complex systems and operates through the fusion of physically-based models that represent natural processes with exponential technologies, including artificial intelligence, that emulate human behaviors and societal outcomes. 
    Beyond the mere collection or provision of information, Environmental Intelligence embodies a cognitive system that senses environmental changes, interprets their meanings, and transforms insights into action—an organized endeavor of humanity to confront global environmental crises with the best of our knowledge and wisdom to sustain the long-term harmony between people and the planet.

            </h3>
            <p class="project-desc">
              This project develops the SOHO (Self-Organizing, Holarchic, Open systems) hydrological
              modeling framework to explore how farmers, institutions, and hydrological processes co-evolve.
              By coupling physically-based watershed models with representations of human decision-making,
              we generate ensembles of possible futures for water quantity and quality under climate and
              policy change, providing insight into robust and adaptive water management strategies for
              agricultural regions.

            </h3>
            <p class="project-desc">
              Using newspaper archives, policy documents, and online media, this project applies machine
              learning and natural language processing to extract signals of public concern, values, and
              policy discourse. These “human social sensing” indicators are compared with hydrological
              extremes and environmental change to understand how societies perceive, react to, and prepare
              for water-related risks, and how these responses shape governance and resilience.

              Integrating field monitoring, watershed modeling, and socio-hydrological analysis, this project
              traces microplastic pathways from land-based sources to rivers. Land use patterns, wastewater
              systems, and hydrological regimes are examined together to explain spatial variability in
              microplastic concentrations and to identify leverage points for reducing plastic pollution in
              freshwater environments and protecting ecosystem and human health.
