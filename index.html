      <!-- Lab Vision -->
      <p class="lead">
        Our vision is <em>Environmental Intelligence for Informed Decisions.</em> Toward this vision, we pursue Truth-Telling through Unfolding the Possibility Spaces and Understanding the Complexity, grounded in three core pillars: Complexity Science, Physically-Based Models, and Exponential Technologies. Complexity science is for better comprehension of human–nature interactions, physically-based models for better representations of environmental processes, and exponential technologies for better interpretations of environmental big data.
      </p>

      <!-- Lab Targets -->
      <p class="lead">
        Albert Einstein once remarked, “Environment is everything.” Our three pillars are not confined to the natural environment alone but also include us—human beings—recognizing that humans and nature are inseparable in addressing today’s global challenges confronting our communities.

    <!-- ENVIRONMENTAL INTELLIGENCE Definition -->
<section id="ei">
  <h1 style="font-family:'Consolas','Courier New',monospace; color:#243b53;">
    Environmental Intelligence
  </h1>
  <p>
    Our concept of Environmental Intelligence refers to an integrative intelligent system that supports informed decisions toward a world where humans and nature are harmonized. 
    It originates from the recognition of environmental systems as complex systems and operates through the fusion of physically-based models that represent natural processes with exponential technologies, including artificial intelligence, that emulate human behaviors and societal outcomes. 
    Beyond the mere collection or provision of information, Environmental Intelligence embodies a cognitive system that senses environmental changes, interprets their meanings, and transforms insights into action—an organized endeavor of humanity to confront global environmental crises with the best of our knowledge and wisdom to sustain the long-term harmony between people and the planet.

        <p class="news-desc">
          Our lab was awarded the NRF Mid-Career Research Grant for the project 
          <em>“Development of a SOHO-Based Hydrological Modeling Framework Enabled by Human Social Sensing for Navigating Agricultural Social-Hydrological Systems and Contributing to HELPING.”</em> 
          This five-year project (Mar 2025–Feb 2030) is funded at 1.35 billion KRW and aims to reinterpret hydrological modeling through the SOHO (Self-Organizing, Holarchic, Open Systems) framework. The project involves international collaboration with the University of Florida and Purdue University.
